# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to take data provided by PyBer; a ride-sharing company interested in understanding the triends in their data to make more informed decisions about the future of the company. PyBer operates in three different types of cities; Urban, Suburban, and Rural and requested data about all types. For this analysis, a line graph was created as well as several tables that break down the number of rides, number of drivers, and the fares for each city type, we will be look at one such table later on. Mulptile tools were used for this analysis to collect and review the data, such as: groupby(), loc(), sum(), count(), and more. Using these tools we were able to break down the data and reconstruct it to provide a more transparent picture of the status of PyBer as a ride-sharing service.
