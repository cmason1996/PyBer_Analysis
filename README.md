# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to take data provided by PyBer; a ride-sharing company interested in understanding the triends in their data to make more informed decisions about the future of the company. PyBer operates in three different types of cities; Urban, Suburban, and Rural and requested data about all types. For this analysis, a line graph was created as well as several tables that break down the number of rides, number of drivers, and the fares for each city type, we will be look at one such table later on. Mulptile tools were used for this analysis to collect and review the data, such as: groupby(), loc(), sum(), count(), and more. Using these tools we were able to break down the data and reconstruct it to provide a more transparent picture of the status of PyBer as a ride-sharing service.

## Results of Analysis

In the above figure the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare Per Ride, and the Average Fare Per Driver are all shown for the three different types of cities that Pyber operates in. As is shown, the Total Rides for Urban cities are the highest, subsequently causing the Total Driver count to be higher than either Suburban or Rural cities. This increase in drivers and rides also may be the cause of a lower Average Fare Per Ride. Inversely, in Rural cities the Total Rides is much lower, leading to an increase in the Average Fare Per Ride. This decrease in Total Rides and Total Drivers for the Rural cities is must likely due to the increased distance between necessary shops and ammenities, causing more people to have their own means of transportation. The opposite could be said for Urban cities, because there is more readily available public transportation, the need to have one's own vehicle is diminished.
