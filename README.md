# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
  The purpose of this analysis was to take data provided by PyBer; a ride-sharing company interested in understanding the trends in their data to make more informed decisions about the future of the company. PyBer operates in three different types of cities; Urban, Suburban, and Rural and requested data about all types. For this analysis, a line graph was created as well as several tables that break down the number of rides, number of drivers, and the fares for each city type, we will be look at one such table later on. Mulptile tools were used for this analysis to collect and review the data, such as: groupby(), loc(), sum(), count(), and more. Using these tools we were able to break down the data and reconstruct it to provide a more transparent picture of the status of PyBer as a ride-sharing service.

## Results of Analysis

  In the above figure the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare Per Ride, and the Average Fare Per Driver are all shown for the three different types of cities that Pyber operates in. As is shown, the Total Rides for Urban cities are the highest, subsequently causing the Total Driver count to be higher than either Suburban or Rural cities. This increase in drivers and rides also may be the cause of a lower Average Fare Per Ride. Inversely, in Rural cities the Total Rides is much lower, leading to an increase in the Average Fare Per Ride. This decrease in Total Rides and Total Drivers for the Rural cities is must likely due to the increased distance between necessary shops and ammenities, causing more people to have their own means of transportation. The opposite could be said for Urban cities, because there is more readily available public transportation, the need to have one's own vehicle is diminished.

  The figure above is a line graph showing a visual representation of the fluctutations of Fare Prices over a period of four months in the beginning of the year 2019. Looking at this line graph we can see that while the different types of cities do see drops and spikes in fare prices, they all remain relatively constant compared to one another. A key difference to note would be the sharp increases in overall fares at the end of March for the Urban and Rural cities, this is most likely due to weather.

## Summary of Analysis
  Based on the above data, the conclusion can be drawn that Fares are more expensive on average in rural cities compared to Urban and Suburban cities as well as the number of drivers seems to have an influence on the average fare price for a city type.

### Recommndations
  Some recommendations for PyBer moving forward would be; to research how the number of drivers in a given area affects the price of the fare and use that data to reallocate or add more drivers to balance out fare prices. To research why the demand for ride-sharing is not as high in rural cities and use that information to restructure policies and practices to either increase the number of drivers or adjust the average fare price to make their service more desirable. And finally, to research the effects of external factors, such as weather, sporting events, concerts, and festivals can have on the demand for rise-sharing and use that research to increase the number of drivers and the average fare to both provide a better service as well as meet any profit goals the company may have
